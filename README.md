       match /messages/{message} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
       }
       match /users/{user} {

         allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == user;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Configure Storage Security Rules**

   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service firebase.storage {
     match /b/{bucket}/o {
       match /chat_images/{imageId} {
         allow read: if request.auth != null;
         allow write: if request.auth != null 
                      && request.resource.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024
                      && request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
